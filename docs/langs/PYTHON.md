## Host Bindings ✔️
The [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py) PyPI package provides an API for embedding the `wasmtime` runtime within a Python program. It allows you to write Python code to provide as module imports or use to consume modules.

You can use `wit-bindgen` to generate a `*.py` file which is annotated with types for usage in mypy or other type-checkers.
